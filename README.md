## Description 

This program is a timed JavaScript quiz game that stores high scores in the browser's local storage. 

The game initiates when the player presses the start button. The player has 90 seconds to answer as many JavaScript-related questions correctly as possible. Answering incorrectly results in a loss of time. When the game is over, the user has the option to store a name and the high score in the game's high scores list. 

The program ensures that the questions are shuffled upon each iteration of gameplay.
